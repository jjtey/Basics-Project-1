Scissors Paper Stone

Submission for Basics Project 1: Scissors Paper Stone, with implementation of Reversed game mode.

<b> How many hours did you spend on this assignment?: </b>

About 2 nights? 

<b> What part of the assignment did you spend the most time on?: </b>

I would think parts on global state. Still unable to implement an output message without any input (ie. a prompt to ask User to input username, as seen in the reference Muk-jji-ppa project)

<b> How comfortable did you feel with this assignment? (1-5): </b>

4 maybe? Manipulating array/element indexes helped streamline the process somewhat?

<b> Is there anything in this code that you feel pleased about?: </b>

Happy it works uh ðŸ¤”

<b> What's one aspect of your code you would like specific, elaborate feedback on?: </b>

Am curious about the modifications to show an output message upon loading the html, without pressing submit button (as per Muk-jji-ppa reference).
In the attached implementation, the prompt to ask for a username is only shown when no input is provided and the submit button is pressed.
